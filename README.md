## These are the steps to recreate this project:
Parcel is a lightweight bundler that works on older setups.
## 1) Make a folder and init npm
- mkdir ~/my-react-app
- cd ~/my-react-app
- npm init -y
## 2) Install React + Parcel + Babel presets
- npm install react@18 react-dom@18
- npm install --save-dev parcel-bundler@1.12.5 @babel/core@7 @babel/preset-env@7 @babel/preset-react@7

## 3) Add a Babel config
## 4) Project structure
## 5) Run it
## 6) Push to GitHub (create a repository on GitHub FIRST)
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "React flashcards with Parcel (no CRA)"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-react-app.git
- git push -u origin main
